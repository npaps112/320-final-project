Motivation

The NFL was founded in Canton, Ohio in 1920. While it has been around for over a century, the "Superbowl Era" has been around for about half that time. 
The 56th superbowl occurred just this year in February. The superbowl in particular, is amongst America's top viewed TV broadcasts nearing 100 million viewers each 
year at thise point in time. Additionally, the NFL is the most viewed sport in America. For more general information about the NFL view the following 
(https://www.ducksters.com/sports/national_football_league.php). NFL teams can end up making 10 million dollars from ticket sales alone when they sell out games. 
Imagine how much more they make for steeper ticket sales and higher viewed games in the playoffs. Revenue is additionally generated through sponsoring. 
The rights to the Rams and Raiders stadium name (So-Fi stadium or Allegiant stadium respectively) are both valued at over 20 million dollars. 
Sponsoring is also seen through the forms of advertisements in the stadium and on TV. It is also worth noting the gambling world is deeply interested in the NFL as

Ignoring the fact that sports teams inherently want to win for the sense of accomplishment and competition, a team in general is greatly vested in performance
from a profit perspective. Not only is success going to increase viewership and ticket sales, but it allows more games to be played in the playoffs which subsequently
generates more. Whether it's for competitive reasons, profit-oriented thinking, or a mix of the two, it is clear why every team should be motivated to make it 
to the superbowl, the highest level of competition within the sport. 

NFL teams are allowed 48 active players on their roster. Given that the NFL has a salary cap, teams must budget their resources while still fielding an entire team.
Because of this, it is important for teams to decide which factors are most important to consider and apply when fielding a team and making a playbook with the goal in mind
making it to the Super Bowl. It is my interest in making a decision-tree regression algorithm while using 10 fold cross validation. This algorithm would 
be meant to predict the winner of a given conference at the time of the end of the regular season. Before getting into the code at all, I am going
to set out the remaining necessary context.

There are currently 32 teams in the NFL, although some teams have been added since the superbowl era. In my program, I only look at years the team has existed.
I do not need to account for when teams move from city to city like I do for them being created in the firstplace even though that has happened throughout the course
of history as well.

Recently, the number of teams admitted to the 
playoffs increased from 6 to 7 for each conference. Currently, there are two conferences: the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football 
Conference (AFC). However, over the course of the first 5 superbowls it was the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL).
The approach to making my algorithm is crucial because it is done in a way where these changes to the league are not complications in my data analysis.
Since I am isolating my analysis to any team's chance to win their own conference, the name of their conference is irrelevant. The idea is that each team 
would be evaluated and compared to the 5 or 6 other teams they are competing against within their conference. Since I will be ranking each playoff team's chance of
winning their conference, the fact that 6 or 7 teams may be in a conference playoff is inconsequential as an extra team in the playoff just means there is one 
more team that could be ranked above any other given team. This accounts for the disparity of more competition in the playoffs. This algorithm is meant to use 
league data from the regular season to rank each playoff team within their conference. The regular season data will be viewed in the lens of comparing a team's
data against that of other teams in their playoff conference as well as that of the whole league. This distinction is important because instead of blandly 
examining a team's regular season performance and data, it is done in both the context of the whole league that year and the specific teams that are 
being pitted against each other. The specific data that will be viewed includes offensive, defensive, special teams, and winning/losing/tying data.


Since there have been 56 superbowls that means there have been 112 conference champions for the two conferences in the league at any time. Looking at 
the following link, one could view which team won and lost any given superbowl (the two champions of the two conferences that year), which division teams are
in, the names of all the current teams, and other general league information and history (https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Football-League). 

The regular season data I scraped comes from THIS WEBSITE (). Since this data includes the playoffs
